Fails to compile with: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror lab2.c

Does not calculate values correctly. Failed on my test data for median and mode.
Incorrect user interface - did not match sample in specification where file 
name is prompted for.
Core dumps if file not found.
Reports values correctly.

Does not use a dynamically allocated array (e.g., with malloc).
Error checking is inadequate (because of aforementioned core dump).

Adequate formating.
Adequate comments.
Contains author indentification, date, and purpose indication.

Contains redundant calculation in median() since you could simply pass 
a pointer to the middle two values to mean() to find the median of an
odd number of values.
I would have had both min() and max() have identical parameter lists to 
provide uniformity and to enable debugging (e.g., printing the array)
if it was needed.
You did not mention your strategy for handling of multi-modal data.
