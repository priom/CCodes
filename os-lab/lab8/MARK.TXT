Compiles with: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pthread threadsort.c

Correctly identifies an invalid command line.
Correctly sorts the data.
Does not write a sorted file.
Does not use threads appropriately
-- threads run sequentially, not in parallel.

Not sure why you have global variables n, i - these could be local
and neither is initialized.
threadsort() is just a wrapper for sort() and is unnecessary.

Adequate formating.
Adequate comments.
Contains author identification, date, and purpose indication.
