Should use isspace() instead of just checking for ' ' and '\t' 
since it will miss some whitespace

Works fine on basic text files, fails badly on files like a.out
Not well tested, can easily get it to produce different results to wc

Adequate formating
Some comments are redundant, e.g., "open file" before fopen()
No author identification
