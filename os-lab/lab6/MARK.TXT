Compiles.
Checks command line arguments.
Coredumps when run with "./a.out 5 12"
Also gives a fatal error for "free(): invalid next size".

No comment with date or indication of purpose.
Poor indentation that is inconsistent - unattractive code.
Error checking could identify the failures more accurately instead of
lumping all the failures into one complicated if statement.

Code structured ineffectively - doing the malloc of a mailbox and the fork
for each value of i is inappropriate - you need n of them only.

Shows some potential but isn't a correct solution.
